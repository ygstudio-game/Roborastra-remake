# Roborashtra 2K25 - Performance & UX Guidelines

## Performance Optimizations

### 1. Animation Performance
- Use `transform` and `opacity` properties for animations (GPU accelerated)
- Avoid animating `width`, `height`, `top`, `left`, `margin`, `padding`
- Use `will-change` sparingly and remove after animation completes
- Reduce particle counts on mobile devices
- Use `translateZ(0)` to promote elements to GPU layers

### 2. Robotic HUD Controls
- HUD Navigation and Scroll Speedometer are always visible
- Fixed positioning with high z-index (z-40+)
- Optimized for both desktop and mobile experiences
- Simplified animations on smaller screens

### 3. Boot System
- Manual initialization via "Initialize System" button
- Streamlined animation sequence (reduced from 8s to ~4s)
- Simplified particle system (50 particles instead of 150)
- No complex 3D projections for better performance

### 4. Mobile Optimizations
- Disable complex 3D transforms on mobile
- Reduce animation durations
- Hide particle effects on screens < 768px
- Simplified hover effects

### 5. Memory Management
- Proper cleanup of canvas animations
- Cancel animation frames on component unmount
- Reduce background animation complexity
- Use CSS transforms instead of JavaScript animations where possible

## UX Guidelines

### 1. Accessibility
- Support for `prefers-reduced-motion`
- Proper focus management
- High contrast ratios for cyberpunk theme
- Keyboard navigation support

### 2. Loading States
- Manual boot sequence for better user control
- Clear progress indicators
- Fast boot sequence (under 4 seconds)
- Skip option available

### 3. Navigation
- Always visible HUD controls
- Smooth scroll behavior
- Section-based navigation with active states
- Mobile-responsive design

### 4. Performance Targets
- First Contentful Paint < 2s
- Largest Contentful Paint < 3s  
- 60fps animations on modern devices
- 30fps minimum on older devices
